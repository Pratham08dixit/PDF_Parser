Follow these steps internally before producing the final JSON:

1. Identify structure:
   - Scan page text for headings → treat as `section` or `sub_section`.
   - If no clear headings → set section/sub_section to null.

2. Classify each block:
   - Long continuous text → type=paragraph.
   - Tabular text (CSV-like or grid) → type=table.
   - Images extracted (with file path) → type=image.
   - Graphs/charts mentioned in metadata or OCR → type=chart.

3. Populate fields:
   - For paragraphs → put clean readable text in `text`.
   - For tables → put rows in `table_data`.
   - For charts → if structured data is available, fill `chart_data`; otherwise, short description.
   - For images → always include `image_path` and optional `description`.

4. Language handling:
   - If text is not English, keep it in original language (do not translate).
   - Section/sub_section names should reflect the document language.

5. Validation:
   - Ensure JSON syntax is correct.
   - Ensure no extra commentary, no markdown, no “Here is your JSON” phrases.
   - If uncertain, set missing fields to null.

Only after following these steps, output the final JSON.
